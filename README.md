# foodorderapp
This is food ordering app. At first after launching you will see many menus
At first i designed the UI and took pictures from google and pasted them to drawable
i usthe images and also used linear layout to organise everything.
Also used intent to switch between another activity
It is done usuing recycler view therefore i needed an adapter
Mostly burgers and pizza. You select on any item we are lead to another activity asking for name and phone number to place order
After writing name and phone it is added to the database using SQLite Database
name of the table is orders
i also made another activity where you can see the order number and price as well
Any CRUD operation can also be performed
